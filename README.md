# RealEstateScraper
Python Script that scapes the web to build a data frame of listings using Pandas

This provides a basic frame work to scrape real estate data from an old version of Century 21's web site. Data is exported to a csv file in the end.

You'll need to be able to work with jupyter notebooks to work with this file, I think.
